Work in progress to implement AEZv4 in pure python.

This code is designed for reference; it is far too slow for actual use
and contains timing issues.  It was implemented based on the
specification at
       http://competitions.cr.yp.to/round2/aezv4.pdf
Do not use it for real crypto.


My code is under the CC0 license/dedication; see cc0.txt for more
information.

The aes implementation here is under its own license. You will need
pyblake2 in order to run it with keys of length other then 384 bits.

The test_vectors.py file was generated by a lightly tweaked version of
the AEZ reference implementation, at
         https://github.com/nmathewson/aez_test_vectors


Nobody besides me has tested this.  Do not use it for real crypto.
